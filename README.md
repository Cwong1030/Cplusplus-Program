# Grocery Item List

GroceryStoreItemList is a program that utilizes Python and C++ integration to produce a list of all item purchases and how many of those items were purchased. It also allows the user to check how many of a specific item was purchased in a given day. Lastly, it can also produces a text-based histogram of the number of each item that was purchased for better depiction if the user so chooses.

By utilizing WHILE and SWITCH loops for the menu, along with the Python integration reading from the input file, the user can search for a item, verify the number of said item, then add that item count to a dictionary for use.

Displaying the histogram was my biggest challenge, I overcame that by utilizing the Python itegration for fileinput within a while loop, thus reading the frequency of each item appearence.

I think an important skill that would be useful is that we learned to integrate files from an entirely different program, and use that itegration to build more complex programs.

I used in-line commments, coventional variable naming, and easily accessible functions in both the Python file and CPP file for easier integration between the two languages.
